# Delay Estimation in a chain of inverters

## Components Required -

- 5 inverters

## Circuit Connections -

- Drag the inverters to the workspace
- Connect inverters in a series fashion and connect the first and last ends to the input and output terminals respectively.

## Observations -

- On clicking "validate" option after completing the circuit (assuming all connections are done correctly) you should see a graph under the observations tab
- Observe the fluctuations occurring
- By default, the input has been set to 1 and the corresponding output observed is 0. To check otherwise, double-click the input.
